TropicTaste Inc. - Exotic Fruit Classification with Machine Learning

Project Overview

TropicTaste Inc., a leading company in the distribution of exotic fruits, aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of its fruit classification process. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the type of fruit based on numerical features.

Currently, the classification process is manual, prone to human error, and resource-intensive. An automated, accurate system is essential to streamline operations and uphold high quality standards.

Objectives

By implementing an automated classification model, TropicTaste Inc. seeks to:

Improve Operational Efficiency: Automating the classification process will reduce time and resource consumption, increasing productivity.
Reduce Human Error: A machine learning model will minimize classification errors, ensuring greater accuracy.
Optimize Inventory Management: Accurate classification will enable better inventory control, ensuring optimal storage conditions for each fruit type.
Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Correct identification and classification will help maintain high product quality, boosting customer satisfaction.
Project Details

Dataset

The model will use a dataset containing various numerical features of exotic fruits, such as weight, size, texture, and color intensity.

Algorithm

The project will implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks, leveraging its simplicity and effectiveness in handling structured data.

Output

The final model will predict the correct type of fruit based on the provided input features.
